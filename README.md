# Binary-Counting-Arduino
This program implements an 8-bit binary counter on an Arduino using Timer1 interrupts. Each bit of the counter is mapped to a dedicated LED, which visually represents the current binary value. When a counter bit is set to 1, the corresponding LED is turned ON; when the bit is 0, the LED is turned OFF.
